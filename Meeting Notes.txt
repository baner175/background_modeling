Sticking with continuous G
Keep track of other bases
3 new papers
implement AIC and BIC in simulation with and without indicators

March 30, 2023:
Use the transformed basis on background data
Use the old basis on mixed data
Write up the new stuff discussed

Q: Do I even need the <1, T> orthonormalization when changing the basis?
Q: Shouldn't we start with an orthonormal (or atleast orthogonal) complete basis?
Q: If we still stick with the polynomial basis I guess that would be restricting us to continuous pdf's only.
Q: Mathematical justification while showing u \perp \mB^* \implies <u, S1> = 0.

New theoretical perspective.
Proving the basis we are working with is the same as starting with orthonormal basis.

Tying for more spread out signal, mixture of exponentials may be or beta.
Try to figure out whether eta estimate is negative or not from the simulations.
MLE expansion of theta.

June 8, 2023:
Correcting and adding MISE calculations with delta method.
Check earlier calculation of bias.
Check if my method for eta actually gives 0.
New papers to compare our method.

June 22, 2023:

Correcting code where g_b was not uniform
Correcting delta method computations
Seeing how correlations come into MISE
Find better simulation cases

July 13, 2023:

Ask Sara's code set up
Delta method gives no closed form expression

Report:
Break it down even more and give some more background
The goal is to estimate \eta
typos
clearly explain why we need orthogonalization and why we are doing it
Why MLE?
Also mention AIC criteria
Try alabama

July 20, 2023:
Look into what S.Mukherjee's paper cited for MISE and AIC equivalence (Jeffrey Heart's paper)
Also look into the classical AIC criteria (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/model-selection-and-model-averaging/E6F1EC77279D1223423BB64FC3A12C37)
play with tolerence of integrate
diachotomous search in optimize(optimize()).
compute unconstrained minimizer and truncate
problem with orthonormalizing

Aug 17, 2023:
Put everything back to [0,1] with transformation inside S1 (check the math)
Try simulation with new g_b suggested by Sara
Save the inner products and rewrite the functions
Read the AIC notes
Think about misspecified model

Jan 24, 2024:
Recap

1. Show simulation
2. The test is unbiased
3. Is the AIC criteria even sensible here?
4. Why r < 2/sqrt(n)?
5. Why not use AIC using log-likelihood?
